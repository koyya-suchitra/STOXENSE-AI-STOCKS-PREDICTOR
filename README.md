# 📊 STOXENSE AI: Stock Price Trend Predictor with LSTM

Welcome to **STOXENSE AI**, an AI-powered stock trend prediction dashboard. This project uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models to forecast stock price movements for numerous companies based on historical prices and technical indicators like **Moving Average (MA50)** and **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**.

The app is built with **Streamlit**, features live or cached data support using `.csv` files, and is deployable to **Streamlit Cloud**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Predicts stock price trends using past data
- 🤖 Deep learning with LSTM networks (Keras + TensorFlow)
- 📊 Visual indicators: Closing Price, MA50, and RSI
- 🧠 Trains the model on-the-fly (10 epochs)
- 💾 Saves trained models for reuse
- 🔍 Supports both live data fetch and offline `.csv` fallback
- 🌐 Deployable on Streamlit Cloud (without needing live API access)

# 📌 How it Works
### Data Fetching
App tries to load stock data from data/{ticker}.csv.
If not found and running locally, it uses yfinance to fetch fresh data and caches it as a .csv.
### Preprocessing
Calculates 50-day moving average (MA50) and RSI.
Normalizes the data using MinMaxScaler.
Generates input sequences for LSTM.
### Model Training
A 2-layer LSTM model is trained for 3 epochs.
Saves model to model/{ticker}_lstm_model.h5.
### Prediction
Predicts and plots closing prices.
Displays Actual vs Predicted graph.

## 💡 Example Stock Tickers You Can Use

You can input the following company ticker symbols in the app to fetch and predict stock price trends.

| Company     | Ticker   |
|-------------|----------|
| Tesla       | TSLA     |
| Apple       | AAPL     |
| Infosys     | INFY.NS  |
| TCS         | TCS.NS   |
| Google      | GOOGL    |
| Microsoft   | MSFT     |

> ℹ️ **Note**: For Indian stocks listed on NSE, append `.NS` to the ticker symbol.  
> Example: `INFY.NS` for Infosys, `TCS.NS` for Tata Consultancy Services.
